# How big is rOpenSci bubble?

### Terminology

    * followers: users that follow @ropensci on Twitter.
    
    * friends: users that follow @ropensci that are also followed by @ropensci on Twitter.

### What to find in this repository

    * number of followers on a given date (`followers-yyyy-mm-dd.rda` and `friends-yyyy-mm-dd.rda` files)

    * geographic locations of followers

### Methodology

I followed Bob Rudisâ€™s [21 recipes for Mining Twitter data with rtweet](https://rud.is/books/21-recipes/index.html)

    * number of followers on a given date is obtained after [`rtweet::get_followers()`](https://rud.is/books/21-recipes/harvesting-friends-and-followers.html)

    * geographic locations of followers was obtained after [rtweet & Google geocoding API function from the ggmaps package](https://rud.is/books/21-recipes/geocoding-locations-from-profiles-or-elsewhere.html)
    
    * the localization requiered me to create an application on [Google Maps Platform](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/), in order to generate a token associated to the app "rOpenSci tweets" (ask me on slack for the .Rprofile with the credentials)

### Downsides

    * Twitter's API does not allow obtaining followers on a date yyyy-mm-dd, it gives you a stock of followers at the time
    of running the API call
    
    * In order to compute the growth rate in the social network, you'll need to run the script `01-data-analysis.R` and use
    the files here to compare the number of followers on date T against followers on date T+t

### Todos

    * total number of mentions in a given time span
    
    * use cosine distance to group same locations written in different ways (i.e. "Boston, MA" vs "Boston, Ma")
